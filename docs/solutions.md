## Automatic PR Code Review

**When to use:** Automatically review every PR opened or updated in your repository.

### Basic Example (No Tracking)

```yaml
name: Claude Auto Review
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize]

jobs:
  review:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: read
      pull-requests: write
      id-token: write
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 1

      - uses: anthropics/claude-code-action@v1
        with:
          anthropic_api_key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
          prompt: |
            REPO: ${{ github.repository }}
            PR NUMBER: ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}

            Please review this pull request with a focus on:
            - Code quality and best practices
            - Potential bugs or issues
            - Security implications
            - Performance considerations

            Note: The PR branch is already checked out in the current working directory.

            Use `gh pr comment` for top-level feedback.
            Use `mcp__github_inline_comment__create_inline_comment` to highlight specific code issues.
            Only post GitHub comments - don't submit review text as messages.

          claude_args: |
            --allowedTools "mcp__github_inline_comment__create_inline_comment,Bash(gh pr comment:*),Bash(gh pr diff:*),Bash(gh pr view:*)"
```

**Key Configuration:**

- Triggers on `opened` and `synchronize` (new commits)
- Always include `REPO` and `PR NUMBER` for context
- Specify tools for commenting and reviewing
- PR branch is pre-checked out

**Expected Output:** Claude posts review comments directly to the PR with inline annotations where appropriate.

### Enhanced Example (With Progress Tracking)

Want visual progress tracking for PR reviews? Use `track_progress: true` to get tracking comments like in v0.x:

```yaml
name: Claude Auto Review with Tracking
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize, ready_for_review, reopened]

jobs:
  review:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: read
      pull-requests: write
      id-token: write
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 1

      - uses: anthropics/claude-code-action@v1
        with:
          anthropic_api_key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
          track_progress: true # âœ¨ Enables tracking comments
          prompt: |
            REPO: ${{ github.repository }}
            PR NUMBER: ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}

            Please review this pull request with a focus on:
            - Code quality and best practices
            - Potential bugs or issues
            - Security implications
            - Performance considerations

            Provide detailed feedback using inline comments for specific issues.

          claude_args: |
            --allowedTools "mcp__github_inline_comment__create_inline_comment,Bash(gh pr comment:*),Bash(gh pr diff:*),Bash(gh pr view:*)"
```

**Benefits of Progress Tracking:**

- **Visual Progress Indicators**: Shows "In progress" status with checkboxes
- **Preserves Full Context**: Automatically includes all PR details, comments, and attachments
- **Migration-Friendly**: Perfect for teams moving from v0.x who miss tracking comments
- **Works with Custom Prompts**: Your prompt becomes custom instructions while maintaining GitHub context

**Expected Output:**

1. Claude creates a tracking comment: "Claude Code is reviewing this pull request..."
2. Updates the comment with progress checkboxes as it works
3. Posts detailed review feedback with inline annotations
4. Updates tracking comment to "Completed" when done

## Review Only Specific File Paths

**When to use:** Review PRs only when specific critical files change.

**Complete Example:**

```yaml
name: Review Critical Files
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize]
    paths:
      - "src/auth/**"
      - "src/api/**"
      - "config/security.yml"

jobs:
  security-review:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: read
      pull-requests: write
      id-token: write
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 1

      - uses: anthropics/claude-code-action@v1
        with:
          anthropic_api_key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
          prompt: |
            REPO: ${{ github.repository }}
            PR NUMBER: ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}

            This PR modifies critical authentication or API files.

            Please provide a security-focused review with emphasis on:
            - Authentication and authorization flows
            - Input validation and sanitization
            - SQL injection or XSS vulnerabilities
            - API security best practices

            Note: The PR branch is already checked out.

            Post detailed security findings as PR comments.

          claude_args: |
            --allowedTools "mcp__github_inline_comment__create_inline_comment,Bash(gh pr comment:*)"
```

**Key Configuration:**

- `paths:` filter triggers only for specific file changes
- Custom prompt emphasizes security for sensitive areas
- Useful for compliance or security reviews

**Expected Output:** Security-focused review when critical files are modified.

            - Potential breaking changes
            - License header requirements

            Be welcoming but thorough in your review. Use inline comments for code-specific feedback.

          claude_args: |
            --allowedTools "mcp__github_inline_comment__create_inline_comment,Bash(gh pr comment:*),Bash(gh pr view:*)"
```

**Key Configuration:**
